# Stroop Effect Analysis

As part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program, this project aims to investigate [Stroop Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect).
Hypothesis testing is used to determine if it takes significantly more time to
say the color of incongruent words than congruent words. The details of the
analysis are provided in 'Inferential Statistics Project.ipynb'.
